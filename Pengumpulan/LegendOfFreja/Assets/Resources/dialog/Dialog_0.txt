[Freja]{freja_11}Griffin? If I'm not wrong, Griffin have the body of lion, and the head and wing of eagle. And their size should be, well....>
[Rowee]Griffin can alter their appearance, missy. And I'm pretty convenient with this mini-sized lovely appearence than the real one. Got problem?>
[Freja]Well, no...>
[Rowee]Fine! Now, find a stone wall that emits orange-colored light in this forest>
[Freja]Where is it?>
[Rowee]Use you feet and eyes, missy! I didn't said that I will show you the way or give you heavy-spoiler of the trial. Remember? Thisfs trial!>
[Freja]{freja_7}Oh, right....>
