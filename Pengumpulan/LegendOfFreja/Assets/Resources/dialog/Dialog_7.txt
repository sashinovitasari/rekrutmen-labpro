[Freja]Is... the trial has over?>
[Rowee]{Qbirdie}Yeah, you did well>
[Freja]{freja_1}But, where are the book?>
[Rowee]{freja_5}...Are sure to do this?>
[Freja]{freja_3}Yes>
[???]For what?>
[Freja]{B01}{Q01}?!>
[Freja]Who are you?!>
[???]{Qdark}Hehehe...>
[Freja]...Me?>
[???]Are you sure doing this? Are you sure you want to do this??>
[Freja]{freja_3}... Yes>
[???]{freja_4}What for? Because it's your duty? Because you're a priestess? A maiden?>
[Freja]No! Because I don't want to see everyone suffering!>
[???]{freja_4}Really?>
[???]{freja_2}Really, really, really??>
[???]Why you don't want to see them suffer? Oh, that not it. You can leave them, ignore them if you don't want to see it>
[???]You don't want to see them suffer because you're Maiden, not because 'you'!>
[Freja]{freja_6}No, that not--->
[???]{freja_2}Do you remember the time when you want to escape from your destiny?>
[Freja]{freja_7}!!!>
[???]You always want to run away from the truth, from the destiny, duty, role as a Maiden>
[???]But it always failed because 'I'm a Maiden, I should not running away'>
[???]You cannot get yourself free from the chain of fate, that's your thought>
[Freja]{freja_10}I--->
[???]{freja_7}Don't you want to live as ordinary girl? Play around with friends, laughing with your family, find a lover and eventually create a family>
[???]I know your answer, an obvious 'yes'>
[???]Because that're what you always longing for, for entire of your life until now>
[???]You know, you can leave them. You can get whatever you want if you can against your role as Maiden>
[???]It's not impossible and hard thing to do. All you have to do is just walk away>
[Freja]{freja_3}No, I won't do that! In the situation like this, I can't do that! If I walk away now, everybody will die because of the wave! I can't allow that-->
[???]{freja_8}--as a Maiden, right>
[???]{freja_7}Come on, throw the thought 'I'm a Maiden'>
[???]I'm asking to 'you'>
[???]Is this want you truly want?>
[???]You think when you use Maeral, everything will go like the plan?>
[???]There's chance to fail, right? And you're about to sacrifice yourself for that>
[???]When you failed, everything will gone. Your people, your life, your wish>
[???]But!>
[???]If you turn away now, there's still time to grant your wishes, to be freed from your duty as Maiden and spending time with people you loves>
[???]The world is ending anyway. You suffer too much until now, it's not a bad thing to live as ordinary human, just what you want, in the last time. Right?>
[Freja]{freja_10}I...>
[???]{freja_9}Don't worry, everyone will understand you and accept your decision. Remember what the head of priest said to you when you left?>
[???]They seems worrying you, and they don't want you to come to this place because itfs dangerous>
[???]See? They won't mind if you didn't do your duty as Maiden, as long as you save. They thinking about you. They won't mad at you> 
[???]You don't have to be afraid>
[Freja]{freja_8}I... can take it of...? The burden for being a Maiden?>
[???]Of course, why not? I'm sure everyone and Shana happy to seeing you again and live with them as ordinary girl>
[Freja]{freja_9}....Shana...>
[???]All you have to do is just turn back--->
[Freja]{freja_1}No>
[???]What?>
[Freja]I remember it. I came to this place to find Maeral, so children like Shana won't suffer anymore>
[???]I told you--->
[Freja]It true that I want to take off my burden as Maiden. It's true that I always wanted not to be a Maiden. I want to live as normal human, running an ordinary life>
[Freja]I really want that and... I'm afraid to sacrifice myself>
[Freja]I don't want to die, I want to go back. There're many things that I want to do>
[Freja]Everything you said is true>
[???]Then--->
[Freja]But I don't want to turn back and let this world ends either>
[Freja]I want to make them happy, I don't want to see anybody died and suffer more than this>
[Freja]I have chance and power to actualize that>
[Freja]{freja_17}And that are what I want as 'me', not as Maiden. I'm just using my power to grant my own wish>
[Freja]I told Rowee before, if I turn back now I will regret it for rest of my life>
[Freja]You now, I'm not good enough to live in regret and guilty>
[Freja]I won't disagree with everything you said, but I don't want to disagree mine either>
[Freja]{freja_16}This is what I want to do, as me>
[Freja]I won't turn around and I will do this>
[???]{freja_15}In the place that filled with malice like this, you can still keep your mind...>
[???]If you have no strong will, you're gone mad right now, hahaha>
[???]So, that's your answer>
[???]Very well then, you deserve it>

[Freja]And please tell anyone, everyone, to always smile. We're all one kind, a family. Even in the hardest time, try to be happy>
